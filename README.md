# Cambria Siege (Prototype)

Baseline prototype for a browser-based action RPG inspired by Lineage II: open map, mob farming for XP + armor parts, timed castle events.

## Goals for this iteration

- Minimal top-down map with free roaming.
- Basic mob spawners with HP/XP rewards and randomized armor drops.
- Inventory/stats UI showing equipped armor bonuses.
- Timed “castle gate” event that grants a buff.
- Code structured so multiplayer sync can be added later.

## Stack

- HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript (no framework yet).
- Simple data-driven config for mobs/loot.
- Runs completely client-side.
